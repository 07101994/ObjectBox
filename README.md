# ObjectBox
ObjectBox is a new superfast mobile database for objects. See the announcement for details:

[ObjectBox â€“ The new Mobile Database (Beta)](http://greenrobot.org/announcement/introducing-objectbox-beta/)

This GitHub repo is a placeholder and will be extended in the future. Right now it serves to [track issues](https://github.com/greenrobot/ObjectBox/issues) with ObjectBox beta.

Beta Notice
-----------
ObjectBox is beta. That also means that, until we reach 1.0, there may be breaking changes. This applies to the API and also to the file format. The latter we will only change if we see really relevant changes that .

Indeed, __the upcoming 0.9.7 changes the DB file format__. It will be more compact and efficient. Because we are doing this very shortly after the first release, we consider to skip upgrading 0.9.6 DB files. It is very likely that this is the last change to the file format before 1.0. We won't promise that but the file format was very stable internally before 0.9.6. Of course, we will always have automatic DB file upgrades after 1.0.
